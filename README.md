## üëã Getting started!

To start the project you‚Äôll need to use `Node.js 20` and `pnpm 8` on your machine.

You can use [nvm (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

To make managing between versions much easier, you can use this little script and automatically change the version when entering your project.

‚öôÔ∏è [Calling 'nvm use' automatically in a directory with a `.nvmrc` file](https://gist.github.com/klaufel/9db737b8896f21b533bd0c0d5a612cea#file-zshrc)

### Start the project

Clone the repository in your machine and install the dependencies `pnpm install`.

**Initializes the server in development mode:**

```node
pnpm run dev
```

**Compile statics chunks and generate a build of application.**

```node
pnpm run build
```

Another scripts allocated in root package but they can be thrown by the different packages:

```node
pnpm run lint // Lint all files

pnpm run ts:check // Check validation of types (TypeScript)

```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Web performance

Performance metrics are measured thanks to `Vercel Analytics`, you can look at the [Vercel analytics dashboard](https://vercel.com/klaufel/recipebook/analytics).

We use [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) metrics to evaluate how our application perform where we can see the detailed metrics along with the web vitals.

You can use tools like:

- [PageSpeed](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
- [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/)

## üöÄ CI & deploy!

For each push and pull request, jobs are executed to ensure the delivery of our code to production. See the [repository actions](https://github.com/klaufel/recipebook/actions).

Automatically for each merge to `main` branch the deployment to production is done, so you don't have to worry about doing anything else.

The project is automatically deployed with Vercel, you can see an environment generated per branch in each pull request.
